Wearing Lederhose, he danced through the festival, embodying the spirit of the vibrant culture.
But strangely a hund arrived, stealing his Apfelkuchen from his pocket of his lederhose.
The hund then hopped into his Porsche and raced to the nearest Flughafen while blasting Rammstein on the radio. 
It was well known that Rammestein was the cultural music of the hund. The band reminded him of its youth chasing BMW owners for doener.

But before he raced to Schloss Eltz, he had to go to the baeckerei to get a gebaeck for his mother.
After the Hund got the Gebaeck for his mother, he stopped at a nearby Biergarten for a quick drink and some merriment.
